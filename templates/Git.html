    <h2>Main commands</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>git status</code>: Show which branch I am in.</li>
        <li><code>git revert &lt;commit&gt;</code>: Undo a commit by createing a new commit that undoes the changes said commit did. You only need to specify the first 6 digits of the commit hash. Another way to specify which commit to undo is to use the <code>HEAD~n</code> syntax where <code>HEAD</code> represents the latest commit and <code>~n</code> is the nth last commit</li>

        <li><code>git diff</code>: Show changes made from last <code>git add</code> (differences between workspace and index).</li>

        <li><code>git diff &lt;commit or branch&gt;</code>: Show changes relative to named <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>. Use <code>HEAD</code> to compare against latest commit or a branch name to compare against tip of a different branch.</li>

        <li><code>git pull</code>: Download changes/commits that have been pushed by others to the remote and merge them into your own local repo. This is actually a combination of <code>fetch</code> and <code>merge</code></li>

        <li><code>git cherry-pick &lt;commit_hash&gt;</code>: Copy the given commit into the current branch.</li>

        <li><code>git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;</code>: Remove <code>file</code> from source control</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Undo</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ul><code>git reset</code>
          <li><code>--soft &lt;hash&gt; </code>: delete commit and bring files modified by said commit into staging area</li>
          <li><code>mixed (no flags) &lt;hash&gt;</code>: delete commit and bring files modified by said commit into working directory</li>
          <li><code>--hard &lt;hash&gt;</code>: delete commit and throw away changes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

<section id="branches">
    <h2>Branches</h2>
    <p>Branches can be thought of as pointers to commits.</p>
    <img src="/static/Images/branches.png">
    <p>In the graph above, each white box represents a commit, each commit points towards the previous commmit, and the branches point towards a specific commit. In general, <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> are the default branch. </p>

    <p>Create and switch branches with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>git branch</code>: list all branches</li>
        <li><code>git branch -a</code>: show all local and remote branches</li>
        <li><code>git branch --merged</code>: show merged branches</li>
        <li><code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: does not switch to the new branch.</li>
        <li><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: creates new branch and switches to it.</li>
        <li><code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: switch to that branch</li>
        <li><code>git push -u origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: push a new branch for the first time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pull Requests</h3>
    <p>When you clone a repo, bracnch it and make changes, you can then push those changes and start a pull request, that is, a request to merge in the changes that you pushed to a branch.</p>
    <p>Pull requests are <em>not</em> a git feature. They are specific to GitHub.</p>
    
    <h3>Merge Conflicts</h3>
    <p>These happen when you want to merge changes you made into a branch that was changed (on the same lines) during the period of time elapsed since you downloaded the original files. When a conflict occurs, git will add the following lines to the conflicting file and it's up to the developer to go and manually choose which lines to leave.</p>
    <img src="/static/Images/conflict.png">
    <p>In the image above, what's between the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and the &equals;&equals;&equals;&equals;&equals;&equals;&equals; is the current version of the code. The rest is what you're trying to merge in.</p>

  <h2>Colab</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start by forking the repo in order to get a copy under your own GitHub account</li>
      <li><code>git clone</code>: clone forked repo into local machine.</li>
      <li><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git</code>: sync local copy to original upstream repo, this allows you to pull changes from original repo to stay up to date</li>
      <li>just before doing your changes, run:</li>
      <li><code>git checkout master</code>: switch to master branch</li>
      <li>(b) <code>git pull</code>: pull repo to make sure you're working on top of latest version</li>
      <li><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: create and switch to new feature branch</li>
      <li>do your changes</li>
      <li><code>git push -u origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: create branch on remote repo</li>
      <li><code>git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: push changes to remote repo</li>
      <li><code>git checkout master</code>: switch back to master branch</li>
      <li><code>git pull origin master</code>: same as step (b)</li>
      <li><code>git merge &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: merge recently created branch into master</li>
      <li><code>git push origin master</code>: push changes to remote repo</li>
      <li><code>git push origin --delete &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: delete branch from remote</li>
      <li><code>git branch -d &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>: delete branch from local (not really necesary, you can leave it if you want)</li>
    </ul>
